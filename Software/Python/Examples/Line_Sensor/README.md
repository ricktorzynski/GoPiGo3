# LINE FOLLOWER SENSOR

# THIS REPO IS DEPRECATED

These files showcase how to use the RED line follower with a GoPiGo3 (the black line follower will not work)

For these files to work, the DI Sensors drivers must first be installed. On Raspbian for Robots they are pre-installed already.

## Installation
If you need to install the DI Sensors repo, this is how to do it:

`curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_sensors | bash`
